            <p>
                When it comes to choosing the right PG, facilities make all the difference. At <strong>Kangaroo House</strong>, we go beyond just providing a room — we provide a complete living experience designed for students near <strong>Ashok Nagar</strong>, <strong>Maharaja Agrasen College</strong>, and <strong>Vasundhara Enclave, Delhi</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you're a college student, a competitive exam aspirant, or a working professional, here's what makes our PG the best choice in the area.
            </p>

            <h2>🛏️ Fully Furnished, Comfortable Rooms</h2>

            <p>
                We know how important good food is — especially when you're away from home. That's why we serve freshly cooked, nutritious meals four times a day: breakfast, lunch, evening snacks, and dinner. Our menu rotates weekly with a mix of North Indian favourites, so you never get bored.

            </p>

            <h2>🔐 24/7 Security & CCTV</h2>

            <p>
                Our common area is the heart of community life at Kangaroo House. Watch your favourite shows on the smart TV, catch up with friends, or just relax after a long day. It's where friendships are made and college memories are shared.
            </p>

            <h2>📚 Study-Friendly Environment</h2>
            <p>
                We understand that academics come first. That's why every room has a dedicated study desk, and the overall environment is kept calm and conducive to learning. Whether you're preparing for exams at Maharaja Agrasen College or studying for competitive exams, you'll find the focus you need here.
